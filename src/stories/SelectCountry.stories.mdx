# Select Country

Select Country component is controlled by Formik.

## Usage

SelectCountry is a custom component using `useField()` which is a React Hook provided by `Formik`. `useField()` includes the `label, <Field> and <ErrorMessage>` components which are again provided by Formik. `<Field>` components by default will render an `<input>` component that given a name prop will implicity grab the respective `onChange, onBlur, value` props and pass them to the element as well as any props we pass to it. Works like a regural HTML select tag. You provide options with `id` and `value` and whatever you want before the closing tag. If you touch the field and don't select an option you will see an error as it mandatory to choose an option. It uses `Yup` package for error handling and validation.

## Checkbox

SelectCountry components are used to retrieve data from users on a page and inside forms.
